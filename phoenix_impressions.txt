## Good

### No inflector
### Plug

## Bad

### PUT vs PATCH

PUT and PATCH do not mean the same thing. It's more appropriate to not have PUT.

### Migration DSL

Migration DSLs are not worth the effort and are, in fact, worse than SQL.

### `resource` routes

`resource` route DSLs are not better than manually specifying routes.

  compare:
    resources "/posts", PostController, except: [:new, :edit]

  to:
    get "/posts", PostController, :index
    post "/posts", PostController, :create
    get "/posts/:id", PostController, :show
    patch "/posts/:id", PostController, :update
    delete "/posts/:id", PostController, :delete

which is more obvious?
